# How to use the PCDC Digest Genorator #
- open the the 'Instruct_Catalog' and 'INRG_Catalog' file and put in a valid API key and key ID (instructions can be found [here](https://gen3.org/resources/user/using-api/#credentials-to-send-api-requests))
- Run file. (I personally used jupyter notebook to do so)
- Output will be two excel files one with the INRG table (Data_Catalog_INRG.xlsx) and one with the Instruct table (Data_Catalog_Ingest.xlsx)
- The excel sheets PCDC_Ingest.xlsx and PCDC_INRG.xlsx are templates and should remain in the folder
- Any cell that has a value of 'Error' has an error in the query that was submitted
